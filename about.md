## Hello,

My name is Harold Treen. Here's a little bit about what I do.

## For Work

During my time in school, I had the opportunity to work at some fantastic companies:

Software Engineer Intern - Vancouver, BC

**Pivotal Labs (Acquired Xtreme Labs Inc.)**  
Software Engineer Intern - Toronto, Ontario

**Microsoft Corporation**  
SDET Intern (Microsoft Office Division) - Redmond, Washington

More information can be found on my [resume](/resume).

## For School

#### University

**Queen's University** - Kingston, Ontario

B.A.Sc. Computer Engineering with Professional Internship  
(4 Years of Classes + 1 Year Internship @ Pivotal Labs)

Some of my favorite courses:

- **Data Mining**: Studied machine learning algorithms for analyzing large datasets.
- **Computer Architecture**: Built a processor from scratch using Verilog (about 150 hours of my life I'll never get back...).
- **Neural Networks**: Built neural networks and studied their applications in a variety of fields.
- **Fundamentals of Software Development**: Built software for controlling a computer using gesture recognition.

#### High School
**Ursula Franklin Academy** - Toronto, Ontario

## For Fun

#### Dancing

{% include carousel.html name="dancing" %}

To any music, in any style. I just like busting moves!

#### Improv

{% include carousel.html name="improv" %}

I began improvising in High School. When I moved back to Vancouver I decided to get back into it. Became instantly hooked and ended up finishing the ICI core series in 4 months.

#### Cooking

{% include carousel.html name="cooking" %}

It's delicious, it's cost effective. Recently I've started hosting dinner parties on the regular to get everyone together and making delicious things.

#### Cycling

{% include carousel.html name="cycling" %}

My favorite mode of transportation. I've also enjoy building/fixing bikes. My first hand-built bike was Android themed (#nerdpower) and survived 2 trips between Kingston and Toronto (300km).

#### Travelling

{% include carousel.html name="travel" %}

I'm a host and surfer on [Couchsurfing](https://www.couchsurfing.com/people/haroldtreen). I enjoy solo backpacking, meeting random people and making things up as I go.

So far visited 14 countries:
