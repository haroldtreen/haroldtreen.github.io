### Hello,

My name is Harold Treen. Here's a little bit about what I do.

Studied for 3 years, did a 12-month internship at Pivotal Labs and now I'm back completing my 4th year of classes.

Some of my favorite courses:
- Data Mining: Studied machine learning algorithms for analyzing large datasets.

- Neural Networks: Built neural networks and studied their applications in a variety of fields.
- Fundamentals of Software Development: Built software for controlling a computer using gesture recognition.

#### High School

During my time in school, I've had the opportunity to work at some wonderful companies:

### For Fun

My interests have been in constant flux since the beginning of time. I am unable to describe them all in a sentence, but here are some of my activities and maybe you can summarize them better then I can...

- **Unicycling**: I was a member of the [Toronto Unicycle Club](http://torontounicyclists.ca/) for 3 years. This involved playing a lot of unicycle basketball, unicycle flaming-puck hockey and riding in parades.
- **Archery**: I was a recurve archer for ~3 years with [Toronto School of Archery](http://torontoschoolofarchery.ca/). In that time I won a few provincial competitions and even placed 1st at the Canadian indoors.
- **Swimming**: Swam for 3 years on the high school swim team as well as getting swim training all the way up to my bronze cross.
- **Rubik's Cube**: Got really into speed cubing for a while. My record for solving was 30 seconds...back in Grade 9.
- **School Politics**: I was the only person in my year to serve on student council for all 4 years of high school. I attribute this to solving a rubik's cube during my speech in grade 9 and name recognition from then on.
- **Ballroom Dance**: I took ballroom dance lessons for 2 years during high school. It was where I spent most of my time and by the second year I was teaching the beginner classes. Learned Salsa, Rumba, ChaCha, Paso Doble, Merengue, Bachata, Tango, Waltz, Quick Step, Foxtrot, Samba, Hip Hop... breadth not depth.
- **All The Dancing**: You will frequently find me dancing up a storm whenever I'm out. I don't think it follows any style...it's just "The Harold Dance".
- **Web Development**: My sister came home with a book on HTML when I was in Grade 7 and I was hooked. During high school I had dreams of building my own website from scratch and making 300,000$ a month from affiliate marketing. My first site was "your-cheap-laptops.com". It never worked out, but probably for the better...
- **Travel**: One of those generic things that all lists of interests should include. My list of countries include: Italy, Britain, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Netherlands, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan...as well as Canada and the US (...Duh).
- **Couchsurfing**: This kind of falls under travel, but is also a community I've been involved in even at home. For those with profiles you can stalk me [here](https://www.couchsurfing.com/users/2104797/profile).
- **Hackathons / Random Projects**: I coding random projects every once in a while. But I have a project section for that <a onclick="app.load('projects')">here</a>.
- **Bicycles**: Not just cycling! In fact I probably enjoy fixing/working with bikes more then riding them. In 2012 I built a bike out of scraps and rode it 330km to Kingston. Since then I have been upgrading that bike and continue to ride it between Kingston/Toronto when weather permits.
- **Cellphone Hacking**: Started with jailbreaking my sisters first generation iPod Touch. When I got my Android phone I also got into "rooting" and other customizations. I even ran a business after 1st year university where I would unlock people's android phones...it was sketchy.
- **Stocks / Finances**: I've been managing my own stock portfolio since 2012. I have no clue what I'm doing but following "Buy High, Sell Low" and "Diversify your portfolio" has caused it to grow 25%+ since then...so not bad.

I'll leave it at that...
