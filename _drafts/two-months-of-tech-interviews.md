The time finally came. 

Full. Time. Job. Search.

Over the last 5 years, I've accumulated over 2.5 years of paid software engineering experience. I've also accumulated a fair amount of self-directed experience.

But - I've never accepted a full-time job...

> Sorry, I have more school to finish.

> Sorry, I want to work in a different city.

> Sorry, I want to travel and focus on my own projects.

> Sorry, I want to attend the Recurse Center.

...until now.

On Monday, I accepted a full-time offer with [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) 🎉.

It was far from the seamless process I imagined it would be. Here's a review of my 2 months interviewing in tech.

### Interview prep

The first step of my journey was interview was prep.

In December I was finishing a batch at the Recurse Center. During the final weeks I switched gears towards interview prep.

I highly recommend taking a week or two to prep. Most of the time between mid-December to early-January was just switching my brain to interview mode.

During this time, I made the mistake of scheduling a phone interview before I was fully confident. I failed pretty spectacularly and ruined a really great opportunity... not good 😢.

### Resume cleanup

I updated [my resume](/resume) before starting applications and a few times throughout the process. Some things I tried to do:

- **One page**: Companies get thousands of resumes, they have limited time to read each one.
- **Use bullets**: They are much easier to skim and help separate discreet achievements.
- **Include metrics**: Numbers help put experience into perspective and communicate impact.
- **Show, don't tell**: Let the experience speak for itself. Building something with a 10/10 rating is better than saying "my project was popular".
- **Less is more**: At the start I tried cramming as much in as possible. Later on I realized that each bullet has diminishing returns.
- **Consistency:** I tried to be consistent with how I mention technologies and structure items.

I shared my resume with a bunch of people for feedback. 

A good experiment is having them repeat back your work history. It will expose areas of confusion and help direct the polishing process.

Here's a .gif of all the iterations it went through.

It changed quite a bit over the course of the 2 months. Looking back, I feel a tad gross having sent out the original version 😅.

### Sending applications

Over the course of my 2 month search, I applied to 43 places.

Here are the stats<sup>\*</sup>:

| Type of application | # Interested | % Interested |
|:--------------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| Online 			  | 4 / 22		 | 18.2 %		|
| Referral 			  | 11 / 21		 | 52.4 %		|
| **Total**			  | **15 / 43**	 | **34.9 %**	|
|---------------------|--------------|--------------|

\* *Interested means I was contacted for some type of interview.*

Something to note: **Referrals were almost 3x more likely to get a response.**

I found referrals via:

- Working with the jobs team at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/hire).
- Contacting past coworkers.
- Broadcasting my job hunt to friends on Facebook.
- Joining digital tech communities (eg. a slack group for technologists in Toronto).
- Talking to independent recruiters.

I would highly recommend reaching out to your networks. Referrals are so much more reliable.

Of the places that weren't interested, it generally fell into the category of *"looking for senior engineers"* or *"looking for US based engineers"* (I'm Canadian 🇨🇦).

***Side note:***  
*Extra thanks to the Recurse Center. They were incredibly helpful during my job hunt.*

*When I originally applied to RC, I thought the recruiting side was just a necessary evil. Now I see it's an invaluable service.*

### Interviews

Of the 43 companies I applied to, 15 went forward with some form of interview.

The process generally followed:

1. Coding test (sometimes)
1. Phone interview
1. Technical phone interview #1
1. Technical phone interview #2 (sometimes)
1. Onsite interviews
1. Hiring decision

When I accepted my job offer, I was in the middle of a few more processes. I ended up having to withdraw my applications - simply not enough time to finish 😥. When I was applying, I tried to avoid this as much as possible by spacing out my interviews. 

Here's how I progressed through my interviews:

### Interview challenges

After my first couple of rejections, I started getting really frustrated with technical interviews.

> These coding problems are so arbitrary! If I ever needed to know this, I could easily Google it.

> I'm not allowed to run the code? How is this testing my actual abilities?

> Yikes! I've been doing nothing but algorithm prep for a month and this is a CSS question...

I wished people would just ask me about my past projects and how I work with other people.

Then I had some really laid back interviews that did just that - those left me concerned.

> That was all conversational... what if they just hire random people who can talk but can't code?!

> He didn't write any notes. What's he going off of other than just gut instinct?

> This is too easy...

By the end I had a new appreciation for how hard it is to interview.

- You can keep things really conversational, but how can you know if someone can actually code?
- You can assign a project, but how can you know if the person will have time to do a good job?
- You can dive into quick algorithm problems, but how much does that actually tell you about the person?

All the while you have a growing stack of applicants just waiting for an interview. 😩

I wonder if any companies let candidates choose. Give a few different options and let the candidate choose the path that works best with their schedule. I'd like to see how that type of system would work out.

### Interview highlights

Luckily, not all my interviews left me banging my head against a wall. Some were really fun! 

- **HackerNews MVP:** One company asked me to build an MVP for HackerNews in 4 hours. I really enjoyed being able to focus on a project without having an interviewer breathing down my neck. The followup was working with some team members to extend the MVP. Since it was my code, we were all working together rather than me being the center of attention. 
- **Life Story:** Two companies had me tell my life story. Where I grew up, how I got into programming, all the steps that lead me to my job hunt. I love asking people to tell me their *Origin Story*, and have spent a decent amount of time thinking about my own. It makes me happy when people are able to articulate it and are willing to share. I liked that the company valued those things as well.
- **Independent Coding Problems:** At one onsite, I was given a sheet of questions and an hour to program solutions. Once again, I enjoyed being able to focus all my attention on the problems. It also gave a break from talking, talking, talking. That was nice.
- **Pass The Tests:** One interview asked me to implement a function to pass a suite of tests. I loved that! As someone who does a lot of TDD, I find it really helpful to have a set of test cases to work through. It helps me concentrate when I can tackle the problem bit by bit.
- **Pairing:** I did a lot of interviews where I was allowed to google and ask questions. They were described as pairing interviews, but didn't feel like it. They usually involved an interviewer sitting across from me looking at their own laptop... not much different from sitting across from me as I write on a whiteboard. I had one really awesome pairing interview though. We both sat at the same workstation and faced the problem together. As a result, it was much easier to point at things and collaborate. That small change made a big difference.
- **Team Lunch:** Most companies with full-day onsites will schedule in some sort of lunch interview. It's supposed to be a chance to relax and ask questions to an engineer. At one company, the lunch was with my entire prospective team. Having everyone meant I could just shut up and see how people interacted regularly. I also got to feel what it was like to spend time with my potential future colleagues.

Besides the interviews themselves, I also had some really good recruiters. People who were super attentive and eager to move things along at whatever pace I was comfortable.

Interviewing was stressful, so every supportive recruiter and well thought out interview was much appreciated ❤️.

### Offers

Learning I had offers was really stressful. 

> Do I take it or finish interviewing with these other companies?

> Is this my market value? Should I negotiate?

> Company A is really cool, but I'll have to move so far. Company B is smaller, but in a better city. How do I choose??

I don't plan on moving again for a while, so it was a big decision. The factors that lead me to choose Squarespace:

- Well established company with a good reputation.
- Team with a bunch of friendly people and interesting projects.
- Being close to the Recurse Center and the awesome communities in New York.
- At the same time, being close enough to Toronto that I can visit easily.

Places in Vancouver were a close second. I met a bunch of wonderful people there during my time at Mobify. Still sad that I won't be as close to them as I would like 😢.

### Some notes for past me

Now that it's all over, what tips would I have for past me...

- **Prepare early:** Interviews are a whole other skill-set - you can't just wing it.
- **Clean up your resume:** Squishing a years worth of activities into 1 item is confusing. It's better to break things up properly and skip some details.
- **Focus on referrals:** It might be easier to upload your resume everywhere, but your chances are way higher with referrals.
- **Research the companies:** Interviews are so much interesting if you can go in knowing what they're working on and why you want to contribute.
- **Write more code by hand:** Interviewing involves a ton of communication. How you work through the problem is just as important and coding the final solution. Practice that thought process.
- **Focus on interviewing resources:** Things like HackerRank are fun because you get to write code and test it out. But working code isn't everything. Resources like "Cracking The Coding Interview" give in depth explanations of all the other things interviewers look for. Did you realize there's a faster solution that uses more memory? Or that assuming a sorted input let's you cut the runtime in half? No, because all you've been doing is passing HackerRank tests!
- **Accept the circumstances:** Some interview are frustrating. Others are great. Analyzing the problems with one over the other never helps. The system isn't perfect, but it's what you have to work with. Do the best that you can with it.
- **Calm. Down.:** Stop worrying about the pros and cons of job A vs. B. Chances are they're both equally amazing for completely different reasons. Flip a coin. Make a choice. The second you do, you'll move on and be excited for what lies ahead.

### Thanks

I couldn't end without sending out some appreciation. 

To everyone who helped me prep.  
To everyone who read over my resume.  
To everyone who forwarded me along to their HR department.  
To everyone who listened to me rejoice after a good interview.  
To everyone who listened to me vent after a bad rejection.  
To everyone who gave guidance and advice along the way.

Thanks ❤️.

It's been a crazy 2 months, and I'm so excited that it's over. 

Let the Squarespace adventure begin! 🙌
