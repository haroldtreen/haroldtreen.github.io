Eight months ago I moved to New York. It's the second time in my "post-university" life that I've lived somewhere new long-term.

These moves have taught me a lot and caused a m√©lange of emotions. I wanted to capture some of those thoughts and feels.

### Lay of the land...

After living somewhere for a while, I discover my favorite places and things to do.
Moving somewhere new erases that familiarity.

When I first arrived in New York, I had to take a month to re-answer the simplest of questions.

- Where do I buy groceries?
- Where are the fun places to hang out?
- What's an express train?
- Who's a good dentist?

Exploring can be fun for a while, but eventually you just want to find a cafe with solid cappuccinos and power outlets.

(I still don't think I've found any offerings comparable to what exists in Toronto...)

Needless to say, I've found figuring out the minutia to be an annoyance.

### Finding activities...

When I arrived in New York I had no existing social circle to drag me out of the house. As much fun as it was to Google things in New York, I needed other ways to spend my time.










Seriously. Ending up in an new city with no pre-existing social circle is overwhelming. Looking back on my journal entries from the early days show many mentions of loneliness.

That's been my largest struggle when moving: making friends.

Not meeting people. That's fairly easy.
Making solid friendships. That's fairly hard.

### The Importance Of Relationships

While living in New York, I've consistently prioritized people over all else. There's a few reasons for this:

- I learn most from interacting with others. Hearing about their stories and experience.
- You are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with.
- Doing things with others is more fun to me.
- People open doors. It's who you know, not what you know.
