The Recurse Center.

> A free, self-directed, educational retreat for people who want to get better at programming, whether they've been coding for three decades or three months.

I heard about it through some well regarded friends back in 2014.  
In 2015, I finally got up the courage to apply.

I was promptly rejected (literally the same day üòÖ).

It was both disappointing and confusing. What had I done wrong? I thought I'd be a great candidate...

- I had just finished my Computer Engineering degree.
- I had worked at numerous tech companies.
- I volunteered with diverse, tech focused organizations.

But I swallowed my pride and moved on.

Fast-forward to June, 2016. ‚è©

I was travelling South America, working on [some side projects](https://epub.press) and starting to crave a better coding atmosphere. Willing to try anything, I decided to reapply to RC.

A few days later I was invited to interview over Skype.  
Then came an invitation to a pair programming interview.

...then came an acceptance email! ‚ù§Ô∏è

In Fall 2016, I had the joy of attending a 12-week batch at the Recurse Center.

### Diffing my applications

While at RC, I learned that you can actually look back at past applications. I pulled up my first and second to see how I had changed between the two.

Here's my [first application](/assets/posts/rc-application-1.jpg).  
Here's my [second application](/assets/posts/rc-application-2.jpg).

I definitely think my second application was much stronger.

Here's some quick comparisons between the two.

***Disclaimer:*** *I don't recruit for RC and have no insight on my applications performance. These are mere humble thoughts.* ü§î

#### **Code CracklePop**

I think both answers are acceptable. The second one is less verbose and likely better.

#### **Please link to a program you've written from scratch.**

I referenced the same project in both applications. In the first I tried talking it up whereas in the second I just left the link and a description. The project may have been more complete the second time it was reviewed...

#### **What is the most fascinating thing you've learned in the past month?**

Lulz! First application I was obviously trying to appear as sentimental as possible üòÖ.

Second application felt a lot more real. It was a specific and unique thing I'd just learned about myself.

#### **What do you want to be doing in two years?**

Kinda funny how similar these two are in places! Both talk about building inclusive communities.

I feel like the second was more specific and direct. It includes a reference to external viewing material and avoids vague phrases like:

> "I want to be working for a company/organization with a strong culture..."

Powerful words Harold... earth shattering, identity shaking words...

#### **Why do you want to attend the Recurse Center?**

I think this is where I lost major points.

From my first application:

> For the past 4 years I've been doing a lot of work with software, but 90% driven by the organizations and groups I was working with.

Not. A. Good. Reason.

The Recurse Center is 100% self-directed. This sentence basically says.

> I've been coding for 4 years and never built anything in my spare time. I only work if I'm being paid.

Compare this to my second application:

> Because for the last 5 months I've been working on projects in awful environments.

So. Much. Better.

1. I've actually been working on things. By myself.
2. I'm working in really poor environments. Coming to RC isn't just about "time to work on stuff", it's about needing a better physical space.

#### **What would you like to work on at the Recurse Center?**

I listed the same project in both applications!

The first time I applied, it was just an idea. I also included a bunch of random explanation as to why I wanted to build it.

The second time it was a fairly mature project. I also had specific improvements rather then a big idea.

I'm not sure if past applications are referred to, but if they are, demonstrating the progress made on my previous idea probably looked good.

#### **Describe your programming background in a few sentences.**

My first application contained more then "a few" sentences üò¨. It was more like a origin story of entering programming and all the random organizations I'd been a part of.

My second application was so much cleaner. A list of specific technologies that showed a wide range of experience.

Way to follow instructions second Harold üëç.

#### **Have you worked professionally as a programmer?**

I love how the first word is the same between the two applications, but the punctuation is different.

- **Application #1:** "Yes!"  
**Translation:** "I'm not sure if I'm qualified for RC, so please accept this extra enthusiasm in lieu of reasons for accepting me!"
- **Application #2:** "Yes."  
**Translation:** "You probably have a million of these to read, so I'll keep it brief."

Second application was more understandable and to the point.

#### **Do you have a Computer Science degree or are you seeking one?**

I really don't think there's problems with either of these, but I love how first Harold replied to a Yes/No question with the exact geographic location of his University.

### Final thoughts

If you have been rejected from RC, **don't give up**.

Keep programming, keep working on side projects and keep working to be a better programmer.

I'm actually glad I got rejected.

Self-directed work is not easy. Learning that skill before going helped me get the most out of the experience. South America was also a much cheaper place to learn than New York.

But I'm also glad I reapplied.

It was an awesome 12-weeks of becoming a better programmer and better person. If you're curious about what I got up to, I [wrote up a whole summary](/tech/recurse/2017/01/27/recurse-center-return-statement/).
