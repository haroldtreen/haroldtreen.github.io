### November 24th, 2019

- I just bought a new 16" Macbook Pro and excited to work on a machine that isn't 7 years old.
- I've been ad-hoc facilitating for a [Mindfulness and Improv group](https://www.facebook.com/presenceatplay/).
- I'm living in Fort Green and enjoying the Brownstone life.
- I switch from Internal Products to the Customer Operations Engineering team at Squarespace. Building all things customer support related.
- I've been going to the gym for the last 7 months and have added 30lbs of body.
- I'm slowing down even more and trying to figure what all the living in the present stuff means.

### January 13th, 2019
- I'm still working at Squarespace in New York (and it's still great 👍).
- I'm still living in the same apartment.
- I'm in the middle of [Team Performance Workshop](https://magnettheater.com/class/improv-team-workshop/) @ The Magnet Theater. It's the final class in Magnet's improv curriculum. Next week will be my first of 8 shows on the main stage.
- I've been simultaneously mentoring a level 1 improv class. They are a super bunch and our class show is Friday!
- I've been going to a bunch of dance parties such as [The Get Down](https://www.thegetdownnyc.com/) and [Daybreaker](https://www.daybreaker.com/communities/nyc/) (and I even volunteer for Daybreaker!).
- I'm still exploring all the activities New York has to offer and recently discovered [The Joy List](https://joylist.nyc/) as an awesome source of events. The most recent one I tried was [Skip The Small Talk](https://www.skipthesmalltalk.org/).
- At the same time I'm trying to slow down a bit. I have the tendency to try and do everything, but recently I've been feeling spread thin. Looking to find more depth with the things I'm already involved in rather than constantly chasing new experiences.
