### August 5th, 2023

- I'm still working on Design tools 🎨. Our teams work was featured at [Figma Config](https://youtu.be/s9fwTc0fRs0?t=988).
- I was cast on an Improv Team at the [Magnet Theater](https://magnettheater.com/). We completed our first season and got renewed for a second 🎉. The team is "Dreamboat" and we're [performing every Wednesday](https://magnettheater.com/ensembles/dreamboat/).
- I've been getting deeper into coffee. I travelled to Portland in April for the SCA Expo and volunteered for 3 days. I also upgraded my espresso setup with a Decent DE1 PRo.
- I've been search of new dance communities and begun some volunteering with [What The Float](https://www.whatthefloat.com/).
- I've been getting back into the gym routine and have a goal of joining the 1000lb club (Squat 1RM + Bench 1RM + Deadlift 1RM >= 1000lbs). I'm currently in the ~782lb club (186lb + 219lb + 377lb).

### April 11th, 2021

- I am now working at Facebook on the Design Tools team 🎉. We build tooling to help engineers and designers create higher quality products.
- I got a chapter published in an O'Reilly book! You can read all my thoughts on "Building An SLO Culture" in Chapter 13 of [Implementing Service Level Objectives](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/implementing-service-level/9781492076803/).
- I moved into my own apartment - first time not living the roommate life.
- I've been leveling up my coffee. Invested in a nice little espresso + pour over setup and making coffee every day ☕️.
- Having my own space has created more opportunities to decorate. Bought a massive bird of paradise and some other plants to lighten up the space.
- I got vaccinated against COVID-19 💉. Excited to see normality on the horizon 🌅.

### November 24th, 2019

### January 13th, 2019

- I'm still exploring all the activities New York has to offer and recently discovered [The Joy List](https://joylist.nyc/) as an awesome source of events. The most recent one I tried was [Skip The Small Talk](https://www.skipthesmalltalk.org/).
- At the same time I'm trying to slow down a bit. I have the tendency to try and do everything, but recently I've been feeling spread thin. Looking to find more depth with the things I'm already involved in rather than constantly chasing new experiences.
