### Autonomous Quadcopter

#### Description:
My 4th year project at Queen's is to develop software for a Quadcoptor which will allow it to autonomously follow the contours of a room. The project received honourable mention on demo day.

We have been working with the ARDrone Quadcoptor and ROS libraries.

##### Written with: C++, C (Arduino)


### Reedly

#### Description:
Reedly was a project I developed and lead for the Queen's Startup Summit in 2015. The goal was to create a website where users could curate personalized ebooks using RSS feeds and web links. By the end of the summit we were the only team to have fully developed a working MVP.

After 48 hours we built a site which allowed users to follow their favourite RSS feeds, groups articles into "books" and publish their books to a kindle.

### Cycling Vest

#### Description:
In 2014 I participated in the Bike Share Toronto Hackathon where I worked as the Android Developer for "Team Locus".

Our project was a vest that could provide directions to cyclists using haptic feedback. This would make it easier for cyclists to navigate a city without the safety risks of using a phone while biking.

### Phone Addict

#### Description:
A simple Android app for monitoring phone usage.
The idea is to use the data to create a metric of the user's "Phone Addiction".

Metrics could include:
- Length between checks
- Length of check (turning the screen on and off vs. screen on to watch a 1 hour movie)
- Number of checks
- Number of pending notifications when check occured

##### Written with: Java (+ Robolectric for android unit tests)

### BackTrack

#### Description:
