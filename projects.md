### **Autonomous Quadcopter**

My 4th year project at Queen's was to develop software for a Quadcoptor which would allow it to autonomously follow the contours of a room.

**The project received honourable mention on demo day.**

We worked with the [ARDrone Quadcoptor](http://ardrone2.parrot.com/) and [ROS libraries](http://wiki.ros.org/).

### **Reedly**

Reedly was a project I developed and lead for the Queen's Startup Summit in 2015. The goal was to create a website where users could curate personalized ebooks using RSS feeds and web links. **By the end of the summit we were the only team to have fully developed and working MVP.**

After 48 hours we built a site which allowed users to follow their favorite RSS feeds, groups articles into "books" and publish their books to a kindle.

### **Cycling Vest**

In 2014, I participated in the Bike Share Toronto Hackathon where I worked as the **Android Developer for "Team Locus"**.

Our project was a vest that could provide directions to cyclists using haptic feedback. This would make it easier for cyclists to navigate a city without the safety risks of using a phone while biking.

**Our project received 3rd place at the hackathon.**

### **Phone Addict**

A simple Android app for monitoring phone usage.
The idea is to use the data to create a metric of the user's "Phone Addiction".

Metrics could include:  

- Length between checks  
- Length of check (turning the screen on and off vs. screen on to watch a 1 hour movie)  
- Number of checks  
- Number of pending notifications when check occured

##### Written with: *Java (+ Robolectric for unit tests)*

### **BackTrack**

Android app for tracking what you did during those nights you "don't remember". The app would generate a timeline representation of your night showing where you went, what pictures you took, and what people were talking about.

Prototype app built in 24 hours for the Queen's Startup Summit 2013.

**The team finished in 3rd place (1000$ prize!)**
