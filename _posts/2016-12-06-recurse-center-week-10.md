### Overall

I'm currently trying to distill through what is essential, and focus on that. Stripping away the excess has left more energy for the important pursuits.

### Emotional üò∞

### **Frantic**

Feels have been evolving recently, but at the moment I feel frantic. There's now only **2** weeks left.

I was reflecting on the first half versus the second half. It seems like I got more done in the first half...
So far I've done a bunch into Haskell but haven't made progress on any **projects**.

I feel disappointed that I haven't built some "Pi√®ce De R√©sistance". I'll have completed all the Haskell resources, but typing out function definitions isn't *sexy*.

I'm feel frantic to find something I can build in two weeks that will prove that **I am better**. A **DRASTICALLY** better programmer.

This desire has also motivated me to constantly be working.

> It's 9pm... but I don't feel accomplished. Gah! Stay later, work longer, we'll be drastically better soon.

Maybe if I went back 3 months, the improvement would be more obvious. I feel drastically better than a year ago, but it's hard to know how much of that has come from RC.

Anyway... I'm frantic to feel accomplished, and it hasn't hit me yet.

### Social üç™

#### **Cookies and Blanket Forts**

On Saturday, some housemates and I baked cookies! Turns out the house had all the extra ingredients I bought and... oops!

In addition to cookies, we also constructed a blanket fort. The cookies were then consumed in the blanket fort while watching a movie. It was glorious:

#### **Weapons of Math Destruction**

On Thursday I went to a meetup hosted at [Postlight](https://postlight.com/). I actually discovered Postlight before discovering the meetup and went more to see what it was like.

I got a chance to talk to the employees about some of their projects, a few of which had overlaps with what I've worked on. The rumors of it being an interesting company were true.

The main event was a talk by [Cathy O'Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathy_O'Neil) on problems arising from the use of Big Data. It was really scary to hear how algorithms can obfuscate problematic systems. Looking forward to reading her book.

### Intellectual ∆õ

#### **Changing Project Plans**

When I first started reading up on Haskell, I was really interested in using it to build a javascript code generator. Pattern matching and types made it seem like a good fit.

After finishing CIS194 I felt differently. I was still interested in that project, but my understanding of Haskell still felt too surface level to be really productive on a project. I also started wondering how much of the project would involve coding vs. writing the Javascript grammar definitions into Haskell.

Instead, I wanted to continue learning Haskell with guidance. So rather than start a project, I've begun working on the second course that is recommended in the Haskell resources I've been using. (For those interested, it's the [NICTA course](https://github.com/NICTA/course))

One of the main features of the course is a test suite, which I LOVE. Why can't every course just be a bunch of unit tests to fix üòç.

Doing another course doesn't feed my need to accomplish a big project while I'm here - but I can build a project in Haskell after RC.

#### **Interview Preps**

This past week I did 2 interview prep sessions. These have been super helpful.

I've done interview prep with friends in the past, but nothing to the level of detail done at RC. Since first starting interview prep at RC, I've started following a system for whiteboard interviews.

Some things I'm trying to do:

- Restate the problem
- Write down assumptions
- Write out an example input and output
- Brainstorm out loud possible solutions and write them down (noting the tradeoffs)
- Write out the API for my code (eg. "I'm going to write a function `X` that will accept an object with properties `a`, `b` and `c`").
- Be as verbose as possible with the doubts that are getting me stuck. Ask questions.
- Create test cases and walk through the final implementation.

This is way better than my previous strategy:

- Code a solution while being as verbose as possible.
- Walk through it after once the interviewer asks you to.

#### **Advent of Code**

I've passively been working through [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/). Think of it as a Advent Calendar that hands out difficult coding problems instead of delicious chocolate.

It's fun, and many people are doing it which leads to good discussion. On the other hand, I've been feeling less enthused about random coding problems. I'm more interested in working on projects.

#### **Essentialism**

I've started reading "[Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077875-essentialism)".

Ironically, I think reading about time management is non-essential - but I'm going to put that aside and pretend it's the book teaching me that.

In the past week I've been thinking a lot about what is essential and what has little value. Sometimes I think of things to cut away, without any immediate idea of what to replace them with. My plan is to fill a lot more of my time journalling and meditating.

### Physical

#### **Park walk**

On Sunday I went for a walk through Prospect Park with some housemates. It was nice to be away from computers and technology and just stroll about. Fresh air always makes me feel better.

#### **Blob**

Days on end of sitting at a computer is really starting to make me feel out of shape. REALLY looking forward to settling in somewhere and being able to do a better job of focusing on my health.

### </End>

Woo! We did it - and it's not even Friday! Getting back on track üòä.

While I may not be feeling like a massively better programmer at the moment, I sure feel like a much better person. I was thinking about how much time I've invested in blogging. I think it's helped maximize what I get out of all these discussions and questions. So that's been nice!

Thanks for reading ‚ù§Ô∏è.

*Hearts to @vaibhavsagar who I am going to mention before even getting any feedback from, because I have much trust in him!*
