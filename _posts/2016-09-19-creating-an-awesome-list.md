Have you heard of **Dunbar's Number**?

> Dunbar's number is a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships.  
> ...humans can comfortably maintain only 150 stable relationships.  
>  - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)

In other words, after **~150 people** our relationships become... fuzzier.  
If we continuously move through life creating new relationships, eventually our earlier ones will be forgotten.

Think about that. On Facebook alone, I've amassed over **750 connections**.

Technically speaking, **75%+** of these people I have very little connection to.
At the same time, the majority are there because we met at some point in time and enjoyed interacting. Maybe not a long time, but quality time.

So where's the balance? How does one continue meeting interesting people without them eventually falling into the void.

I like to think of the Awesome Listâ„¢ as my ideal 150 people.

They aren't the people I talk to on a day to day basis.  
They aren't the people I've spent the most time with.  
They aren't even necessarily people I feel close to.  

They are the people who are a joy to be around.  
They are the people who make me think differently.  
They are the people who are discovering what they want and moving towards it.  

#### **Adjectives of the Awesome:**

Awesome is more a gut feeling than an exact science.  
But I'll attempt to lay out the qualities that I appreciate the most.

**Thoughtful / Open-Minded**

- Having strong opinions, yet interested in learning the views of others.
- Self-aware of their needs and feelings.
- Black-belt empathizers.
- Always questioning their assumptions.

**Honest / Genuine**

- Having strong boundaries.
- Direct about their wants and desires.
- Put invitations out into the world without expectations.
- Accountable in their relationships with others. (See: [Relationship Accountability](http://www.estherperel.com/relationship-accountability/))

**Driven / Inspired**

- Having side projects that excite and inspire them.
- Investing time and energy into their interests.
- Take pride in their work.
- Bringing people together to collaborate and create.

**Warm / Caring**

- Inclusive and welcoming to those around them.
- Excellent listeners.
- Sharing appreciation freely.
- Invest time and energy into the people they care about.

**Quirky / Outgoing**

- Having a creative side.
- A sense of humor that leaves you LMFAO-ing.
- Welcome the unconventional (eg. onesie foam parties? Let's do it!).
- Accept invitations enthusiastically.

I maintain this list in an attempt to remember all the awesome people I have met.

One day my monkey brain is inevitably going to run out of space for all the people I've met.  
By reflecting on the Awesomes, hopefully I can maintain those connections a little bit longer.
