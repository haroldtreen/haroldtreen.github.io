Super excited to announce that EpubPress is now [open for testing](https://github.com/haroldtreen/epub-press-chrome/releases)!

### **What is EpubPress?**

EpubPress is a service for generating beautiful ebooks from your favorite websites.

It turns this:

![Tabs](/assets/posts/tabs.jpg)

into this

![Ebook](/assets/posts/ebook.jpg)

### **Why would I use this?**

Reading on an eReader is a much better experience then reading in a web browser.

- eReader screens are easier on your eyes.
- eBooks don't require an internet connection.
- eBooks don't have distracting ads, menus and banners. Only. Content.
- eBooks let you group information together (eg. "News from this week", "Top 10 travel articles").
- Reading with a book is more comfortable then sitting in front of a computer.
- Flipping pages is nicer then clicking through tabs.
- eBooks are easier to share with friends than lists of URLs.

I could probably go on...

### **How is this different from other extensions?**

Currently there are 2 main options for sending content to your eReader:

1. **Using a bookmarklet to send individual sites to your reader.**
  - Causes your eReader to be filled with books containing single articles.
  - Time consuming to send articles individually.
  - Doesn't provide a way of grouping information.
2. **Syncing entire RSS feeds to your eReader.**
  - Creates books with WAY too much content (90% of which you probably won't read)
  - No easy way to merge content from multiple sources.

EpubPress allows you to create eBooks with only the content you want - in one click. Super simple. Super flexible.

### **How do I get it?!**

Yesterday I released an Alpha version of the Chrome Extension on the [project page](https://github.com/haroldtreen/epub-press-chrome/releases).
All the instructions are there to get up and running.

It's still early days (everything has been built in the last week!), so problems are probable.

But give it a try, and together we can work through the bumps :)!

Any issues can be reported to [support@epub.press](mailto:support@epub.press).  
Any feedback and feature requests can be sent to [feedback@epub.press](feedback@epub.press).

Happy (e)Reading!
