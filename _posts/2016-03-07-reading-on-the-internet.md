We love reading on the internet. The quantity, quality and diversity of content is unparalleled. All accessible at the click of a button (or a hyperlink...).

RSS is an awesome way of following content on the internet. An endless stream of articles and blog posts from your favorite sources. Going onto Feedly and scanning through content has been a daily ritual... but also a bit of a tedious one.

- Context switching between scanning long lists of items and opening articles.
- Staring at a bright screen for hours.
- Hunching over a computer.

**It's a bit of a pain.**

Five years ago I bought a Kindle and found it was a way better reading experience than bright backlit screens. What if there was a way to get all that internet goodness onto that beautiful e-ink screen. Turns out there is a way!

Here's what I would do:

1. Login to my RSS.
2. Find all the articles I was interested in.
3. Open each article in a separate tab.
4. Go through each tab and individually save articles to a "Read It Later" service.
5. Open Calibre.
6. Run a custom recipe to turn my reading list into an ebook.
7. Email that ebook to my Kindle.

The result?  
A custom book with all the content I wanted to read. **It. Was. Awesome.**

But still tedious.

If Big-H is the time complexity for how long it takes me to do something, reading went from **H(N)** to **H(2N + 2)**. Boo!

It's been a problem that's bothered me for some time and I kept saying I would build a solution. Well, now I'm travelling South America with lots of freedom and...

Last night I pushed an updated version of my Chrome Extension [EpubPress](https://github.com/haroldtreen/epub-press-chrome/releases/tag/0.1.0) that lets you do all those things in **H(N)** time.

This is how I read articles now:

1. Login to my RSS.
2. Find all the articles I'm interested in.
3. Open each article in a separate tab.
4. Publish all my open tabs into a book with EpubPress.

There is a game. It has now been changed.  
Give it a try and see if it's the better way for you!
