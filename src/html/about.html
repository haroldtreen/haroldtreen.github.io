<h3 id="for-fun">For Fun</h3>
<p>My interests have been in constant flux since the beginning of time. I am unable to describe them all in a sentence, but here are some of my activities and maybe you can summarize them better then I can...</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unicycling</strong>: I was a member of the <a href="http://torontounicyclists.ca/">Toronto Unicycle Club</a> for 3 years. This involved playing a lot of unicycle basketball, unicycle flaming-puck hockey and riding in parades.</li>
<li><strong>Archery</strong>: I was a recurve archer for ~3 years with <a href="http://torontoschoolofarchery.ca/">Toronto School of Archery</a>. In that time I won a few provincial competitions and even placed 1st at the Canadian indoors.</li>
<li><strong>Swimming</strong>: Swam for 3 years on the high school swim team as well as getting swim training all the way up to my bronze cross.</li>
<li><strong>Rubik&#39;s Cube</strong>: Got really into speed cubing for a while. My record for solving was 30 seconds...back in Grade 9.</li>
<li><strong>School Politics</strong>: I was the only person in my year to serve on student council for all 4 years of high school. I attribute this to solving a rubik&#39;s cube during my speech in grade 9 and name recognition from then on.</li>
<li><strong>Ballroom Dance</strong>: I took ballroom dance lessons for 2 years during high school. It was where I spent most of my time and by the second year I was teaching the beginner classes. Learned Salsa, Rumba, ChaCha, Paso Doble, Merengue, Bachata, Tango, Waltz, Quick Step, Foxtrot, Samba, Hip Hop... breadth not depth.</li>
<li><strong>All The Dancing</strong>: You will frequently find me dancing up a storm whenever I&#39;m out. I don&#39;t think it follows any style...it&#39;s just &quot;The Harold Dance&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Web Development</strong>: My sister came home with a book on HTML when I was in Grade 7 and I was hooked. During high school I had dreams of building my own website from scratch and making 300,000$ a month from affiliate marketing. My first site was &quot;your-cheap-laptops.com&quot;. It never worked out, but probably for the better...</li>
<li><strong>Travel</strong>: One of those generic things that all lists of interests should include. My list of countries include: Italy, Britain, Germany, Austria, Czech Republic, Switzerland, Netherlands, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan...as well as Canada and the US (...Duh).</li>
<li><strong>Couchsurfing</strong>: This kind of falls under travel, but is also a community I&#39;ve been involved in even at home. For those with profiles you can stalk me <a href="https://www.couchsurfing.com/users/2104797/profile">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Hackathons / Random Projects</strong>: I coding random projects every once in a while. But I have a project section for that <a onclick="app.load('projects')">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Bicycles</strong>: Not just cycling! In fact I probably enjoy fixing/working with bikes more then riding them. In 2012 I built a bike out of scraps and rode it 330km to Kingston. Since then I have been upgrading that bike and continue to ride it between Kingston/Toronto when weather permits.</li>
<li><strong>Cellphone Hacking</strong>: Started with jailbreaking my sisters first generation iPod Touch. When I got my Android phone I also got into &quot;rooting&quot; and other customizations. I even ran a business after 1st year university where I would unlock people&#39;s android phones...it was sketchy.</li>
<li><strong>Stocks / Finances</strong>: I&#39;ve been managing my own stock portfolio since 2012. I have no clue what I&#39;m doing but following &quot;Buy High, Sell Low&quot; and &quot;Diversify your portfolio&quot; has caused it to grow 25%+ since then...so not bad. </li>
</ul>
<p>I&#39;ll leave it at that!!!!</p>
