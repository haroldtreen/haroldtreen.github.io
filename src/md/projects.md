### Phone Addict

#### Description:
A simple Android app for monitoring phone usage.
The idea is to use the data to create a metric of the user's "Phone Addiction". 

Metrics could include:
- Length between checks
- Length of check (turning the screen on and off vs. screen on to watch a 1 hour movie)
- Number of checks
- Number of pending notifications when check occured
